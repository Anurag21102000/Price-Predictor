# Retail Analytics Case Study

This case study consists of three checkpoints. The case study is about exploratory data analysis and customer purchase behavior analysis in the retail domain, specifically focusing on Black Friday sales data.

## Checkpoint 1: Data Manipulation and Visualization using Python

### Objectives

- Data preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature engineering.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to understand customer purchase behavior, identify patterns and trends, and explore relationships between variables.
- Descriptive analysis: Calculate descriptive statistics, generate visualizations, and conduct statistical tests.
- Customer segmentation: Segment customers based on their purchase behavior.
- Predictive modeling: Build predictive models to forecast customer purchase amounts.

### Tasks

- Load the dataset, explore its structure, and perform data cleaning and transformation.
- Utilize Python's data visualization libraries to create informative visualizations.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover insights.
- Summarize findings and trends from the data manipulation and visualization tasks.

## Checkpoint 2: Visualization using Power-BI Dashboard and Model Building using ML Algorithms

### Objectives

- Create an interactive and visually appealing Power BI dashboard for the project.
- Build machine learning models to predict customer purchase amounts.

### Tasks

- Import the preprocessed dataset into Power BI and design an interactive dashboard.
- Utilize Power BI visualizations to explore different aspects of the dataset.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for price prediction.
- Compare model performance and select the best-performing algorithm.
- Interpret trained ML models to gain insights into prediction factors.

## Checkpoint 3: Final Presentation and Viva

### Objectives

- Prepare a final presentation including all checkpoint achievements.
- Present findings, insights, and recommendations to stakeholders.

### Tasks

- Prepare a crisp final presentation that showcases achievements from all three checkpoints.
- Participate in a Q&A session to discuss the case study, methods, and results.

## About the Case Study

Black Friday is a significant shopping event in the United States. The case study focuses on customer purchase behavior analysis during Black Friday sales. The dataset includes customer demographics, product details, and purchase amounts. The objectives include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, segmentation, predictive modeling, and recommendations for sales and marketing strategies.

For more details, refer to the specific tasks and deliverables outlined for each checkpoint.

## Data Analysis Tasks (Checkpoints)

### Checkpoint 1: Data Manipulation and Visualization using Python

#### Task 1.1: Data Manipulation and Visualization

- Load the dataset using Python's pandas library.
- Explore the dataset using functions like `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`.
- Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.
- Transform the data as necessary for analysis.
- Create informative visualizations using matplotlib or seaborn.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover insights.

#### Task 1.2: Exploratory Data Analysis & Statistical Analysis

- Perform descriptive statistics for numerical and categorical variables.
- Conduct bi-variate and multi-variate analysis.
- Identify and treat missing values.
- Analyze and treat outliers.
- Scale data using min-max and/or Z-score normalization.
- Perform relevant hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square, Anova tests).

### Checkpoint 2: Visualization using Power-BI Dashboard and Model Building using ML Algorithms

#### Task 2.1: Visualization using Power-BI Dashboard

- Import preprocessed dataset into Power BI.
- Model data relationships and apply necessary transformations.
- Design an interactive Power BI dashboard.
- Visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and exploratory visualizations.
- Implement cross-filtering and slicing functionalities.
- Create narrative-driven visualizations for insights and storytelling.

#### Task 2.2: Model Building using ML Algorithms

- Prepare training and testing datasets.
- Select suitable ML algorithms for price prediction.
