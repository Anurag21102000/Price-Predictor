## Problem Statement
A retail company aims to understand customer purchase behavior, specifically the purchase amount, for various products across different categories. This project involves analyzing a dataset containing customer demographics, product details, and purchase summaries. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the purchase amount for customers, which will enable the company to create personalized offers for different products.

## Data Acquisition
The dataset includes the following features:
- User_ID: User ID
- Product_ID: Product ID
- Gender: Sex of User
- Age: Age in bins
- Occupation: Occupation (Masked)
- City_Category: Category of the City (A, B, C)
- Stay_In_Current_City_Years: Number of years stay in the current city
- Marital_Status: Marital Status
- Product_Category_1: Product Category (Masked)
- Product_Category_2: Product may belong to another category as well (Masked)
- Product_Category_3: Product may belong to another category as well (Masked)
- Purchase: Purchase Amount (Target Variable)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the purchase amount for customers based on the provided dataset. By building a predictive model, the retail company aims to enhance its understanding of customer behavior and tailor personalized offers. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started
